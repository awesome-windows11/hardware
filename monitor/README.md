## Types of Matrix
**IPS** is the most commonly used and preferred type of computer monitor, providing a bright color display and sharp details. The color-matching performance has a broad scope, ranging from just average to completely amazing. IPS computers can also support the best features for gaming, including fast pixel responses and high refresh rates.

The downfall of most IPS monitors is a lack of contrast and a truly rich black, which can make images with a lot of shadows appear murky. This is accentuated when viewing in a dark environment, such as a gaming den or home theater room.

Increasing in popularity recently, **VA** monitors have become an option due to high brightness and vivid colors, which are comparable to IPS monitors. VA monitors also have a better contrast ratio and darker black levels for overall better image quality. When used for gaming, VA monitors can offer excellent motion clarity and above-average view angles, particularly vertically. However, they do tend to suffer when viewed from a side angle. IPS monitors tend to have better motion clarity at most price points. VA technology is more commonly used in TVs than PC monitors.
