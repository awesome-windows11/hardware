## Types of Matrix
**IPS** is the [most commonly](https://www.adorama.com/alc/how-to-choose-a-computer-monitor/) used and preferred type of computer monitor, providing a bright color display and sharp details. The color-matching performance has a broad scope, ranging from just average to completely amazing. IPS computers can also support the best features for gaming, including fast pixel responses and high refresh rates.

The downfall of most IPS monitors is a lack of contrast and a truly rich black, which can make images with a lot of shadows appear murky. This is accentuated when viewing in a dark environment, such as a gaming den or home theater room.

Increasing in popularity recently, **VA** monitors have become an option due to high brightness and vivid colors, which are comparable to IPS monitors. VA monitors also have a better contrast ratio and darker black levels for overall better image quality. When used for gaming, VA monitors can offer excellent motion clarity and above-average view angles, particularly vertically. However, they do tend to suffer when viewed from a side angle. IPS monitors tend to have better motion clarity at most price points. VA technology is more commonly used in TVs than PC monitors. The disadvantages are gosting and mediocre response time, which may not appeal to fans of dynamic games.

**TN** displays consist of a panel of liquid crystals that are sandwiched between two polarizing filters. When an electrical current is applied, the crystals twist and allow light to pass through. TN panels are generally the least expensive option available in the market. They have very fast pixel response times, which improves motion clarity.

However, TN displays do have limitations in contrast, view angle, and color performance that make them less suitable for everyday use. TN monitors are best suited for dedicated gaming setups. BenQ’s Zowie line is a good example of an affordable screen that can help improve gaming performance.

**OLED** uses organic pixel elements that emit their own light. OLED technology is known for its excellent contrast and black levels as the OLED pixels that are turned off emit no light at all. These displays surpass other panel types in color performance and have best-in-class motion clarity. Additionally, viewing angles are superb.

However, OLED panels aren’t as bright as the competition at the top end. Over time, OLED displays may suffer permanent image retention (also called ghosting), although this takes many thousands of hours. Furthermore, the technology is very expensive in PC monitors.

IPS is the most popular display technology and can provide an excellent viewing experience when paired with the right combination of other specifications. For most people, IPS is the way to go, but a monitor with a VA panel might be a better choice if you do not view it from an angle and want improved image quality while watching movies and TV shows.

## Size (inches)
When it comes to monitors, the most popular sizes are typically 24, 27, or 32 inches. While some may think that bigger is always better, it is important to consider how the size of a display fits within your field of view. This means that you should be able to see all parts of the screen without having to strain your eyes or move your head around too much.

Ultrawide monitors are becoming increasingly popular and are widely available in the market. They are generally categorized as having a 21:9 aspect ratio. A 34-inch ultrawide monitor is as tall as a 27-inch screen but seven inches wider, offering a 25-percent larger display overall. This makes it an ideal choice for people who want more display space, but do not want to deal with the complexity of a multi-monitor setup.

Most budget monitors have a native resolution of 1080p (1920×1080). This is suitable for 24-inch monitors. However, on larger displays, the lack of sharpness becomes quite noticeable. For 27-inch and 32-inch models, a resolution of 1440p (2560×1440) is preferable. For gaming purposes, this resolution is nearly essential, but it is worth noting that the PS4 and PS5 do not support it. PC gamers will benefit from the crisper details offered by this resolution.

For larger monitors, 4K (3840×2160) resolution is ideal. While the added sharpness is not a must-have, it is particularly useful if you work on minute details or large amounts of information all at once, requiring you to zoom out. 4K resolution will bring out the finest details in movies and games, making them look incredibly sharp.

Price is a crucial factor when choosing a monitor. Lower resolutions mean lower prices, but the price gap has narrowed in recent years with 4K monitors becoming increasingly more affordable.

Most modern monitors have an aspect ratio of **16:9 or 21:9**. The first option is the most universal and is suitable for any task, whether it is work, study, searching the Internet, watching videos or gaming. 

Devices with a **21:9** ratio are preferred by specialists in video editing and programming, as well as fans of modern games and movies. Ultra-wide monitors allow you to comfortably work with several applications at the same time and enhance the effect of immersion during the gaming process.

Less common are displays with an aspect ratio of **32:9**. They are designed to replace the configuration of two 16:9 monitors with a single workspace. Thus, the user can get rid not only of frames, but also of unnecessary wires. 

## Refresh Rate (Hz)
A monitor’s refresh rate refers to the frequency at which it can update the displayed image every second. While many monitors come with a 60Hz refresh rate, 144Hz is quickly becoming the new standard. Some models offer higher refresh rates, like 240Hz or 360Hz, with premium 500Hz options also available. Higher refresh rates offer a smoother visual experience, especially when the displayed images are in motion. They also reduce input lag by displaying new images more frequently. As the refresh rates go higher, the benefits become more noticeable. 

For those who primarily use their monitors for productivity, a 60Hz refresh rate is sufficient. However, if you are into fast-paced movies, graphics, or games, you will find the upgrade to 144Hz to be quite noticeable. Higher refresh rates offer a luxury for premium entertainment options and can provide a competitive advantage for serious gamers, but they are not exactly a must-have.

## Adaptive Sync
Adaptive Sync is a feature that enables a PC’s video output to synchronize with the refresh rate of a display. This ensures smooth frame pacing, preventing hitches, hesitations, and tearing, provided that the PC’s hardware is up to the task. This feature is a must-have for PC gamers, but it is also present in many budget monitors. 

There are two common standards for Adaptive Sync based on video card manufacturers: AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync. These are designed to work with their respective video cards, so it’s important to pay attention to the monitor’s supported standards. Additionally, there’s a third-party standard called VESA AdaptiveSync, which is supported by AMD, Intel, and Nvidia in their latest graphics solutions. However, the functionality may be more limited than using the company’s in-house standard. Adaptive Sync is commonly associated with gaming, but has no real price premium attached to it, and is a feature that will improve your experience.

## Flicker-Free
Today, virtually all monitors are equipped with some form of vision protection system. Flicker-Free and Flicker Safe indicate the absence of eye-damaging PWM (Pulse Width Modulation). Low Blue Light technology reduces the emission of blue light, which also reduces eye strain.
