### Cherry MX Red (linear)
**Cherry MX Red** is fondly loved by gamers. These are the most common switches for gaming. They're linear, which is great for quick, repeated presses. They're also pretty **easy** to press, unlike the **Cherry MX Blac**k (45g vs. 60g). This is both a plus and a minus: your fingers are less tired, but it's easier to accidentally press an unnecessary button. It's up to you to either increase the accuracy of your presses or exercise your fingers.

- For gamers whose fingers get tired or other switches feel heavy
- In the office to relax and not disturb your coworkers too much.
- Lovers of softness and smoothness
- Home
- To the office
