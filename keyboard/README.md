## Mechanical switches
### Cherry MX Red (linear)
Cherry MX Red is fondly loved by gamers. These are the most common switches for gaming. They're linear, which is great for quick, repeated presses. They're also pretty easy to press, unlike the Cherry MX Black (45g vs. 60g). This is both a plus and a minus: your fingers are less tired, but it's easier to accidentally press an unnecessary button. It's up to you to either increase the accuracy of your presses or exercise your fingers.
