### SSD Form Factors
At this point in the market, you'll have to choose between two formats: a 2.5" SSD or an M.2 module.

### 2.5"
The classic 2.5" format is known from laptop hard drives. With the exception of the thinnest laptops and tablets, almost everything has a 2.5" drive. The format is quite convenient, as it is familiar to most users from hard drives. And there are no problems with connection. In the case of a 2.5" SSD, standard SATA power and data connectors should be connected, there are no problems with this in modern cases. In addition, SSD configurations can now also be found in the NAS sector, where they offer advantages such as low power consumption and low latency.

Another advantage of 2.5" drives is that they are typically built in an aluminum enclosure that effectively dissipates component heat through heat transfer pads. Therefore, the controllers inside usually do not overheat.

However, 2.5" drives do have their drawbacks. The main one is the SATA interface, which limits read and write throughput to about **550 MB/s**. Only a few server SSDs can be connected via the faster U.2 port.

### M.2
2.5" SSDs take up some space even at 7mm thick. SATA cables should be added to the form factor. There is simply no space for 2.5" SSDs in compact devices, which is why M.2 modules have become increasingly popular in recent years. Initially they spread in the notebook segment, but then moved to desktop PCs as well.

The advantage of M.2 SSD is also in the interface: modern models no longer use SATA, but rely on the faster **PCI Express**. However, older motherboards and laptops may only support M.2 SSDs in SATA format, while newer ones may only support PCIe NVMe, even though they may mention "M.2 SSD" support everywhere. So when upgrading older motherboards or laptops, you should pay attention to the supported interface. You should also be careful if your motherboard has multiple M.2 slots.

### NAND (non-volatile flash memor)
The key differences between the types of NAND are the cost, capacity, and endurance. Endurance is determined by the number of Programme-Erase (P/E) cycles a flash cell can undergo before it starts to wear out. A P/E cycle is the process of erasing and writing a cell and the more P/E cycles that the NAND technology can sustain the better the endurance of the device.

**Single-level cell (SLC)** NAND stores only 1 bit of information per cell. The cell stores either a 0 or 1 and as a result, the data can be written and retrieved faster. SLC provides the best performance and the highest endurance with **100,000 P/E** cycles so it will last longer than the other types of NAND. However, its low data density makes SLC the most expensive type of NAND and therefore not commonly used in consumer products. It is typically used for servers and other industrial applications that require speed and endurance.

**Multi-level cell (MLC)** NAND stores multiple bits per cell, although the term MLC typically equates to 2 bits per cell. MLC has a higher data density than SLC so can therefore be produced in larger capacities. MLC has a good combination of price, performance, and endurance. However, MLC is more sensitive to data errors with **10,000 P/E** cycles and therefore has a lower endurance compared to SLC. MLC is usually found in consumer products where endurance is less important.

**Triple-level cell (TLC)** NAND stores 3 bits per cell. By adding more bits per cell, this reduces the cost and increases the capacity. However, this has negative effects on performance and endurance, with only **3,000 P/E** cycles. Many consumer products will use TLC as it is the cheapest option.
